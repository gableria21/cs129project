# üéüÔ∏è CS129 System Project: TRAZE - A Travel Pass Record System üíª
A project in Object-Oriented Programming (CS129-8L)  

### Description: 

The program that was assigned to this group is a ‚ÄúTravel Pass Record System‚Äù, which
process an application for the request of a Travel Pass provided his or her reasons for traveling
are those allowed in the program. It is an essential system for the government to monitor the
persons allowed to travel outside of their region for the purpose of the observance of a record
system for those traveling outside of their city or region giving distinctions whether the
an individual is an LSI or a regular traveler.

The user will be required to enter his or her personal information, identity whether
Locally Stranded Individual (LSI) or a regular traveller, point of origin and the point of
destination and date of application. The program can process the application for the travel
pass. The system keeps records of a database for future viewing. It can generate a sorted list of
all travel pass holders arranged chronologically based on date of application, a sorted list of
travel pass holders who are locally stranded individuals arranged chronologically based on date
of application, and make a tally of the total number of travel pass holders that are leaving or
going home to Metro Manila.

The program was written in Java Programming Language using
Netbeans IDE, and uses MySQL for the storage of the information.
